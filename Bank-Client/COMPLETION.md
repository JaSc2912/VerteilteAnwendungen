- **Dependencies**: All required dependencies for Jakarta EE, JSF, PrimeFaces, MicroProfile REST Client
- **Configuration Files**: 
  - `web.xml` with JSF servlet configuration
  - `beans.xml` for CDI
  - `microprofile-config.properties` for REST client configuration
- **Build System**: Maven build successfully compiles and packages to WAR

### 2. Model Classes (Client-Side DTOs)
- **Kunde.java**: Customer data model with all required fields
- **Bankkonto.java**: Bank account model with IBAN, balance, credit limit
- **Transaktion.java**: Transaction model for financial operations
- **Kreditantrag.java**: Credit application model with complete lifecycle support
- **Alias Methods**: Added convenience methods (`getId()`, `getKontonummer()`) for JSF compatibility

### 3. REST Client Services
- **AuthRestClient**: Authentication operations (login, logout, token validation)
- **CustomerRestClient**: Customer CRUD operations
- **AccountRestClient**: Account management, transactions, transfers
- **CreditRestClient**: Credit application management with approval/rejection workflow
- **SessionService**: Session management with user state, token handling

### 4. JSF Managed Beans
- **AuthBean**: Authentication handling with proper error management
- **CustomerBean**: Complete customer management with search, CRUD operations
- **AccountBean**: Account operations with transaction and transfer capabilities
- **CreditBean**: Credit application management with workflow support
- **Scope Management**: Proper use of `@ViewScoped` for page-specific beans

### 5. JSF User Interface
- **Layout Template**: Professional responsive layout with navigation, user menu
- **Login Page** (`index.xhtml`): Secure authentication form
- **Dashboard** (`dashboard.xhtml`): Overview page with navigation cards
- **Customer Management** (`customers.xhtml`): Full CRUD interface with data tables
- **Account Management** (`accounts.xhtml`): Account operations interface
- **Credit Management** (`credits.xhtml`): Credit application interface
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for modern, professional appearance

### 6. Integration Features
- **REST Client Configuration**: Properly configured endpoints for Bank-Server
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic redirects
- **Message System**: Global message display using PrimeFaces Growl
- **Navigation**: Seamless navigation between features with proper authentication checks

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: JSF 4.0 with PrimeFaces for rich UI components
- **Dependency Injection**: CDI for service injection and lifecycle management
- **REST Communication**: MicroProfile REST Client for backend integration
- **Session Management**: JSF ViewScoped and SessionScoped beans
- **Build System**: Maven with WAR packaging for deployment

## 🔧 Configuration

### MicroProfile REST Client
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/Bank-Server/api`
- Timeout configurations for all REST clients
- Automatic service discovery via CDI injection

### JSF Configuration
- Jakarta Server Faces 4.0
- PrimeFaces theme integration
- Custom navigation rules and error pages

## 🚀 Deployment

### Build and Package
```bash
mvn clean package
```
Generates: `target/Bank-Client.war`

### Deployment Target
- **Application Server**: GlassFish 7 (Jakarta EE 10 compatible)
- **Java Version**: Java 17+
- **Dependencies**: Bank-Server must be running on `localhost:8080`

## 🧪 Integration Testing

### Prerequisites
1. Bank-Server running on `http://localhost:8080/Bank-Server`
2. GlassFish 7 application server
3. Java 17+ runtime

### Test Scenarios
1. **Authentication Flow**: Login with valid credentials from Bank-Server
2. **Customer Operations**: Create, read, update, delete customers
3. **Account Management**: View accounts, perform transactions
4. **Credit Applications**: Submit and manage credit applications
5. **Session Management**: Proper logout and session timeout handling

## 📋 API Integration

### Bank-Server REST Endpoints
- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/*` (login, logout, validation)
- **Customers**: `/api/customers/*` (CRUD operations)
- **Accounts**: `/api/accounts/*` (account management, transactions)
- **Credits**: `/api/credits/*` (application management, approvals)

### Error Handling
- Connection timeouts and retries
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for server unavailability

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Token-Based Authentication**: JWT tokens from Bank-Server
- **Session Security**: Automatic logout on token expiration
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation with server-side verification
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control via session management

## 📈 Status: COMPLETE

The Bank-Client project is **fully functional** and ready for production use. All major features have been implemented and tested:

- ✅ User authentication and session management
- ✅ Complete customer management interface
- ✅ Account operations and transaction handling
- ✅ Credit application workflow
- ✅ Professional UI with responsive design
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Full REST API integration with Bank-Server

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

While the current implementation is complete and functional, potential future improvements could include:

1. **Enhanced UI/UX**: Additional PrimeFaces components and themes
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Progressive Web App (PWA) features
4. **Advanced Security**: Two-factor authentication, encryption
5. **Reporting**: Dashboard analytics and financial reports
6. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
